# Appendix 1 #

	It has been my approach to always begin my study of the scholia with as little commentary from modern scholars as possible. I prefer to let the evidence speak for itself. Therefore for the use of the reader, I offer this Appendix which contains the full Greek text of all the scholia I have quoted and any other scholia I would consider relevant to the topics I discuss but did not have the space to include in my main chapters. I also provide my accompanying translations into English.Chapter One:πάρακειται τὰ Ἀριστονικου σημεῖα καὶ τὰ Διδύμου Περι τῆς Ἀρισταρχου διορθώσεως τινὰ δὲ καὶ τῆς Ἰλιακῆς προσωδιως Ἡρωδιανοῦ καὶ ἐκ τῶν Νικάνορος Περι στιγμῆς“Cited are the Signs of Aristonicus and Didymus’s On the Critical Text of Aristarchus and also some of Herodian’s Iliadic Prosody and from Nicanor’s On Punctuation.” Chapter Three:Line 8.12ὡς τὰ οὐράνια τρία διαστήματα ἔξει ἀέρα μεχρι νεφελῶν, εἰτα αἰθέρα μέχρι τῶν φαινομενων· οὕτως καὶ ἀπο γῆς εἰς ἄδου· ἀπὸ δὲ ἀδου εἰς Τάρταρον· ἐναντίος δὲ Ὀλύμπω ὁ Τάρταρος· ὁ μὲν γὰρ “οὔποτ’ ἀνέμοισι τινάσσεται· οὐδέ ποτ’ ὄμβρῳ” (Od. 6.43) ὁ δὲ καὶ τετάρακται καὶ ψυχρὸς εἶναι δοκεῖ καὶ γοῦν τὸ σφόδρα ῥιγοῦν ταρταρίζειν φασίν. καὶ ὁ μὲν ὅλος καταλάμπεται· ὁ δὲ ἠερόεις ἐστίν“Since heaven has three distinct parts: the lower air spans up until the clouds, then the aether spans up until the visible places. In a similar way so it goes both from earth to Hades and from Hades to Tartarus, Tartarus is in opposition to Olympus. For the one, “never shook with winds, nor with heavy rain” (Od. 6.43). And the other seemed to be both chaotic and cold, indeed they say that to fall into Tartarus is to be violently cold. The former is wholly shone upon. The latter is murky.” Line 8.16τόσσον ἔνερθ' Ἀΐδεω:τοσοῦτον φησὶ τὸν Τάρταρὸν. ἀφεστᾶναι τοῦ Ἅιδου ὅσον οὐρανος τῆς γῆς. δια δὲ τούτων σφαιροειδῆ τὸν κόσμον συν ἵστησι κέντρου λόγον ἐπέχουσαν εἰσαγαγῶν τὴν γῆν καὶ τὰς ἁπ αυτῆς. ἐμβαλλομένας εὐθείας εἰς εκὰτερα τὰ περατα ἴσας λέγων εἶναι⁑  “All the way down to Hades:He says that Tartarus is as far below Hades as Ouranus is above the earth. And on account of these things he makes the cosmos spherical, he has introduced the earth in the relation of the center [of the cosmos], he says that [going] straight from the earth to each opposite side is equidistant.” Line 8.13ἐναντίος Ὀλύμπῳ ὁ Τάρταρος· ὁ μὲ`ν γὰρ.  "οὔποτ' ἀνέμοισι τινάσσεται· οὐδέ ποτ' ὄμβρῳ" (Od 6.43)· οὗτος δὲ τετάρακται· καὶ ψυχρὸς εἶναι δοκεῖ· ὅθεν καὶ τὸ σφόδρα  ῥιγοῦν ταρταρίζειν φασίν· καὶ ὁ μὲ`ν ὅλος καταλάμπεται ὁ δὲ` καὶ ἠεροειδής ἐστιν⁑“Tartarus is opposite to Olympus. For the one, "never shook with winds, nor with heavy rain" (Od 6.43). And the other was chaotic and it seemed to be cold, from which they say that to fall into Tartarus is to be violently cold. And the one is wholly shone upon and the other is cloudy.” Line 8.16τὰ οὐράνια ὥς φησι τρία διαστήματα ἔχει· ἀέρα μέχρι νεφελῶν· εἶτα αἰθέρα μέχρι τῶν φαινομένων· καὶ τῆς Διὸς ἀρχῆς· οὕτω καὶ ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς εἰς Ἅδου, ἀπὸ δὲ Ἅδου εἰς τὸν Τάρταρον· δῆλον δὲ ὡς τὸ μέσον κέντρον ἲν ἡ γῆ· ἔδει δὲ εἰπεῖν "τόσσον ἔνερθε" γῆς. ὅσον ἀπ' αὐτῆς εἰς οὐρανόν· τάχα οὖν τὸ Ἀΐδεω ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ Ἅδου φησίν⁑“The heavens, he [the poet] says, have three distinct parts. The lower air spans up to the clouds. Then the aether spans up to the visible places and the throne of Zeus. And in a similar way so it goes from the earth to Hades, from Hades to Tartarus. And so the earth is clearly as the middle center point. And it is right to say that it is as far beneath the earth as the earth is from heaven. And indeed perhaps he [the poet] calls it Hades because of the rulership of Hades.” Line 8.13Τάρταρος:τὸ ὑπὸ τὴν γῆν ἐσκοτισμένον. μέρος κατώτατον τοῦ Ἅδου· καὶ ἐν βαθuτάτῳ κείμενον τόπῳ. ἢ τὸν χαλεπὸν καὶ δυσχερῆ λέγει. ὠνόμασται δὲ. δια τὸ ἐκτετάχθαι καὶ συγκεχύσθαι τὰ ἐν αυτῷ πάντα· οἱ δὲ τὸ ἀφώτιστον τῆς οἰκουμένης μέρος ἀπεδέξαντο⁑“Tartarus:The place in shade below the earth, it is the bottommost portion of Hades. And he calls it that which lies in the deepest region or that it is both difficult and vexatious. And it is so named because of the drawing out and the confounding of everything in itself. But others understand it as the unlit region of their inhabitance.” Chapter Four:Line 8.93πρὸς ἐπιστροφὴν τὸ ἐπίθετον τέθειται· δεῖ γὰρ τὸν στρατιώτην τοιοῦτον εἶναι· γεωργὸς μὲν γὰρ ἀπὸ τοῦ καλῶς ἐν πόᾳ καὶ τὴν ἅρπην· καὶ τὰ ἄλλα τῆς γεωργίας ὅπλα κινεῖν γινώσκεται· κυβερνήτης. ἀπὸ τοῦ "πόδα νηὸς" (Od.10.32). ἰθύνειν καλῶς· τέκτων, ἀπὸ τῆς εὐθεσίας τῶν λίθων. καὶ τῆς εὐπριστίας τῶν ξύλων· ναυπηγὸς, ἀπὸ τῆς νηός· κυνηγὸς. ἀπὸ τῆς κυναγωγῆς καὶ τῆς ὀρεσινομίας· μάντις ἀπὸ τῶν ἐκβάσεων· μάγειρος ἀπὸ τοῦ ὡς δεῖ ὀπτᾶν καὶ δαιτρεύειν· ἰατρὸς. ἀπὸ τοῦ νόσους γινώσκειν καὶ τάμνειν ἰούς· μουσικὸς καὶ ἀοιδὸς. ἐξ ᾠδῶν κάλλους καὶ μύθων· πύκτης καὶ παλαιστὴς ἐξ εὐστροφίας καὶ χειρῶν συμπλοκῆς· τοξότης ἀπὸ διασκέψεως ἀρίστης· ἀκοντιστὴς. ἀπὸ τοῦ εὖ πάλλειν τὸ δόρυ ῥήτωρ ἀπὸ πιθανότητος· στρατηγὸς. ἀπὸ φρονήσεως καὶ ἀνδρίας· στρατιώτης. ἀπὸ πολυμηχανίας καὶ πολυπειρίας⁑“The epithet is used because of the retreat. For it is necessary for him to be such a soldier. For he is a farmer [as we know] well from the sickle in the grass and the bill hook and all the things which are necessary for farming.  He is a ship-steerer because he keeps the sail straight (Od.10.32). The carpenter, from the good condition of the stone. And from the skillful sawing of wood. The shipbuilder from the ship. The hunter from the hunting packs and from the knowledge of the mountains. The seer from landing places. A cook from as is necessary roasting and cutting up. A doctor, from which there is sickness to diagnose and to cut out arrows. A musician and a minstrel from which there are songs of beauty and speeches. The boxer and the wrestler from versatility and the wrestling grip. The archer, from the best ability to examine. The javelin-thrower, from his good poise with a spear. The orator, from his persuasiveness. The general from his foresight and manly courage. The soldier from craftiness and great experience.”  Line 8.93πρὸς επιστροφὴν τὸ ἐπίθετον⁑ Α εστι δὲ γεωργος  		"ἐν ποίη δρεπανον μέν" (Od.18.368)· Β κυβερνήτης 			"ἀεὶ γὰρ πόδα νηός" (Od.10.32)Γ τέκτων 			ἀπο τῆς κλίνηςΔ ναυπηγός 			ἀπὸ τῆς σχεδίαςΕ κυνηγός 			ἀπὸ τοῦ Παρνασσοῦ Ϛ μάντις 			"φημι τίς μοι φάσθω" (Od.20.100)Ζ μαγειρος			"δαιτρεῦσαι τὲ καὶ ὀπτησαι" (Od.15.323)Η ἰατρος 			"ὄφρα οί εἴ ϊοὺς χρίεσθαι" (Od.1.262-263)Θ μουσικος			"μῦθον ὥς τ' αοιδός" (Od.11.368)Ϊ πύκτης			"πῦν μὲν ενίκησα Κλυτομήδεα" (Il.23.634)ΙΑ παλαιστής 			"Ἀγκαῖον δὲ πάλη Πλευρώνιον" (Il.23.635)ΙΒ δισκευτής			παρα ΦαίαξινΙΓ τοξότης 			"εῦ μὲν τόξον οῖδα" (Od.8.215)ΙΔ ἀκοντιστής 			"δουρὶ δὲ ἀκοντίζων" (Od.8.229)ΙΕ ῥήτωρ καὶ αστρολογος 	"Πληϊάδας θ' ορόωντι (Od.5.272)·“The epithet is for the retreat. 1. He is a farmer 		"in the grass, curved scythe" (Od.18.368)2. A steersman 			"for I always [steered] the sails of the ship" (Od.10.32)3. A carpenter 			from the bed  4.

A javelin-thrower 		"throwing a spear" (Od.8.229)15. An orator and an astronomer "looking upon the Pleiades" (Od. 5.272)”  Line 8.97ὡς ἔφατ' οὐδ' ἐσάκουσαι:προς τὸ ἀμφιβολον πότερον οὐκ αντελάβετο καθόλου τῆς φωνῆς δια τὸν θόρυβον, ἠ ἀκούσας γὰρ ἐπαρεπέμψατο, ὅπερ δέχεται ὁ Ἀρίσταρχος“So he spoke, but he did not hear/listen:Regarding the ambiguity, whether he [Odysseus] did not generally perceive his [Diomedes’s] voice on account of clamor, or having heard him he passed along, as Aristarchus takes it.” Line 8.97οὐδ’ εσάκουσεν, "οὐδὲ ἤκουσεν" ἐξηγεῖται δὲ πότερον οὐκ αντελάβετο καθόλου τῆς φωνῆς δια τὸν θόρυβον, ἢ ἀκούσας παρεπέμψατο, ὅπερ δέχεται ὁ Ἀρισταρχος“He did not hear/listen,"οὐδὲ ἤκουσεν" It is interpreted whether he [Odysseus] generally did perceive his [Diomedes’s] voice on account of clamor, or having heard him he passed along, which is how Aristarchus takes it.” Line 8.97οὐδ’ ες ἄκουσεν:"οὐδὲ ἤκουσεν" ἐξηγεῖται δὲ πότερον ἄρα οὐδ’ όλως ἤκουσεν ὁ Ὀδυσσεὺς, ἢ οὐκ ἐπείσθη δειλίαν τοῦ ἥρωος κατηγοροῦσιν ἀγνοοῦντες τὸ "οὐδ’ ἐσάκουσεν", οὐ γὰρ τὸ παρακοῦσαι. ἀλλα τὸ μὴ αἴσθεσθαι τελείως δηλοῖ καὶ γὰρ οὐκ ῆν δειλὸς τῶν ἄλλων εσχατος φεύγων καὶ τῆ βραδυτῆτι τὸ φιλοκίνδυνον ἐπιδεικνύμενος ⁑“He did not hear/listen"οὐδὲ ἤκουσεν" he interprets whether Odysseus did not wholly hear, or whether he was not persuaded. They charge the hero with cowardice, ignoring the "οὐδ’ ἐσάκουσεν." For it is not “not listening.” But rather it is a lack of perfect perception, and because he is not  a coward since he flees last of all the other men and because of his slowness he is a specimen of a man who loves danger.”  Line 8.97οὐκ ἤσθετο ὑπὸ τοῦ θορύβου· ἢ οὐκ ἐπείσθη διὰ τὸν καιρόν· φεύγει γὰρ σὺν Αἴαντι καὶ θεομαχεῖν οὐ θέλει· πῶς γὰρ δειλὸς. ὁ μετὰ πάντας φεύγων· οὐ γὰρ ἂν Διομήδης τοῦτον μόνον ἐκάλει·⁑“He does not hear because of the noise or he is not persuaded because of the crisis. For he flees with the Ajaxes and he does not want to wage war against the gods. For how is that cowardly? He is fleeing with everyone else. Because Diomedes would not have called out to him alone.” Line 8.266Τεῦκρος δ είνατοςὅτι πάντων ὑποστρεψάντων, μόνος ὁ Ὀδυσσεὺς παρέμεινε πρὸς ταῖς ναυσὶν ὥστε τὸ ἐπάνω εὐκρινὲς "ὡς ἔφαθ’ οὐδ ἐσάκουσεν" (Il. 8.97) ὅτι ἐκουσίως παρεπέμψατο⁑“Teucer was ninthThe sign is there because everyone turned around, only Odysseus remained next to the ships so that the above line is in good order "as he spoke he did not listen" (Il. 8.97) because he voluntarily sent himself past.”   Line 8.266διῄρηκεν ὡς μέλλων περὶ αὐτοῦ λέγειν· ἔνδον δέ ἐστι Ὀδυσσεὺς τὸν λαὸν διεγείρων. ἀλλ' οὐδὲ Θόαντος μέμνηται· καὶ οὐ πάντως ἐστὶ δειλός ⁑“The poet makes a distinction because he is about to speak about him [Teucer]. But Odysseus is within rousing the soldiers. Thoas is also not mentioned and he [Thoas] is not entirely cowardly [either].”  Chapter Five:Line 8.408αἱεὶ γάρ μοι ἕωθεν ἐνικλᾶν όττι νοήσω·"ἐνικλᾶν" ἐμποδίζειν ἡ μεταφορὰ ἀπο τῶν εἰς τὰς ἀσπίδας ἀποθραυομένων δοράτων· οὕτως δὲ γραπτέον "ὅττι κεν εἴπω" οἶον κατακάμπτειν καὶ μὴ ἐὰν τὰ ὑπ εμοῦ εἰρημένα καὶ πάλιν ἑξῆς ἐν οῖς ἡ Ί ̈ρις φησην (Il. 8.422) "ὅττι κεν εἴπῃ" γράφεται ⁑“For she is always accustomed to hinder me in whatever I have devised:ἐνικλᾶν means “to hinder.” It is a metaphor from spears being struck against shields. And it must be written like so "ὅττι κεν εἴπω." That is, to hinder and not to permit what is said by me. Again it is later written in the lines [that] Iris says (Il. 8.422) “ὅττι κεν εἴπῃ”” Line 8.408ἐμποδίζειν· εἴληπται δὲ ἡ μεταφορὰ, ἀπὸ τῶν εἰς τὰς ἀσπίδας ἀποθραβομένων δοράτων⁑"to hinder" and the metaphor is taken from spears being struck against shields.” Lines 8.524-8.525μῦθος δ' ὃςἀθετοῦνται δύο στίχοι. δι ὅτι τῇ ἑξῆς οὐδὲν λέγει καὶ τὸ ὑποτακτικὸν ἄρθρον ἀντι προτακτικοῦ παρείληπται "ὃς μὲν" ἀντὶ τοῦ "ὁ μέν." ὁ δὲ νοῦς ἐστι τοιοῦτος περι μὲν τῶν νῦν καὶ τήμερον συντετέλεστέ μοι ὁ λόγος καὶ οὐδὲν παραλέλειπται περὶ δὲ τῶν εἰς αύριον ὑπο τὴν ἕω μηνύσω ⁑“The counsel which:The two lines are athetized because the poet says nothing in the following lines  and he substitutes the relative pronoun "ὃς μὲν" instead of the definite article "ὁ μέν." But the intention is of this sort: concerning the things now and today, the speech has been completed by me and nothing is left out and, concerning the things happening tomorrow, at dawn I will reveal them.” Line 8.526εὔχομαι ἐλπόμενοςὅτι Ζηνοδοτος γράφει "ἔλπομαι εὐχόμενος"· οὐ κατα τὸν Ἕκτορα δὲ τὸν οὕτως ἐπηρμένον λέγει, ἐλπίζω εὐχόμενος τοῖς θεοῖς· ἐπιεικὲς γὰρ τουναντιον γὰρ οἰκεῖον "εὔχομαι ἐλπόμενος" καυχώμαι ἐλπιδοποιούμενος ὑπο τοῦ Διὸς καὶ τῶν ἄλλων θεῶν “I pray having hoped:The sign is there because Zenodotus writes "ἔλπομαι εὐχόμενος." He does not say Hector is lifted up thusly, I feel hope praying to the gods. Because the opposite is suitable and appropriate, "I pray, feeling hope." I speak aloud being made hopeful by Zeus and the other gods.” Line 8.526-8.527ὅρα τὸ παλίμβολον Ἕκτορος· τῇ γυναικὶ ἔλεγεν "ἔσσεται ἦμαρ ὅτ' ἄν ποτ' ὀλώλῃ Ἴλιος ἱρὴ" (Il. 6.448). ὧδε δὲ ἄλλως· ἐκεῖ μὲν γὰρ τῶν Τρώων ἡττωμένων δύσελπις ἦν· ἐνταῦθα δὲ τῇ μάχῃ κρατῶν. ἐλπίζει τὰ χρηστά⁑“Look at the change of mind of Hector. He was speaking to his wife "The day shall come when sacred Ilion is destroyed" (Il. 6.448). And it is so elsewhere. For there he is despondent because the Trojans were inferior. But here he hopes for good fortune because they are superior in battle.” Chapter Six:Line 8.429+ τῶν· αλλος μὲν ἀποφθείσθω·ὅταν εἰς τὴν ἀξίαν ἀτενίση. τῶν θεῶν· τότε φασὶν αὐτοὺς μὴ κινεῖσθαι τῆ περι θνητῶν ὡς οὐδε ἂν ἡμεῖς περι μυρμήκων· ὅταν δὲ ἐπιλογίσηται τὴν ποιητικήν ἕπεται τοῖς μύθοις καὶ τὴν ὑπόθεσιν ἐκτραγωδεῖ συμμαχίας καὶ θεομαχίας παραγων “Let one of them perish:Whenever he [the poet] is looking at the reputation of the gods, then he says they would not be moved by anything concerning mortals. Just as we would not be moved concerning ants. But whenever he considers poetry, he follows the stories and makes the subject famous: bringing about alliances and wars among gods.”  Line 8.429ὅτ’ ἂν εἰς τὴν ἀξίαν ἀτενίσῃ τῶν θεῶν, τότε φησὶν αὐτοὺς μὴ κινεῖσθαι περὶ θνητῶν· ὡς οὐδὲ ἂν ἡμεῖς περὶ μυρμήκων· ὅτ’ ἂν δὲ ἐπιλογίσηται τὴν ποιητικὴν, ἕπεται τοῖς μύθοις καὶ τὴν ὑπόθεσιν ἐκτραγωδεῖ. συμμαχίας καὶ θεομαχίας παράγων⁑“Whenever he [the poet] is looking at the reputation of the gods, then he says they would not be moved by anything concerning mortals. Just as we would not be moved concerning ants. But whenever he considers poetry, he follows the stories and makes the subject famous: bringing about alliances and wars among gods.” Line 8.284Ἡρακλῆς πορθήσας Ἴ¨λιον Ἰσιώνηντὴν Λαομέδοντος θυγατέρα Πριαμου δὲ ἀδελφὴν ἔλαβεν αἰχμάλωτον καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ γέρας Τελαμῶνι ὡς συστρατεύσαντι αὐτῷ ἀφ ῆς ἔσχε Τευκρον ὁ Τελαμών ὡς οὖν ἀπο Τρωϊκῆς γυναικὸς τεχθέντα τὸν παῖδα  Τεῦκρον ἐκάλεσαν προ ἀναπέμψαντες τὸν τόνον καὶ ποιήσαντες κύριον.

From her, Telemon had Teucer. Since he brought into the world by a Trojan woman, he called the child Teucer, moving the accent back and making it a proper noun. For the Trojans were called the Teucrians from their king Teucer. The story is more precisely told by many others and by Apollonius the grammarian in the second generation. It is asked how having received praise from everyone Teucer is now a bastard. We say that it was not a cause for dishonor. Because the custom of the ancients prevails. For they honored bastards equally with legitimate children. And otherwise if someone was a spearman or a commoner but a royal. And on account of the magnification, we say that this is said for excellence that he surpasses the legitimate children.” Lines 8.371-8.372ἥ οἱ γούνατ' ἔκυσσε:ἀθετοῦνται δύο στίχοι ὅτι οὐκ έδει κατὰ μερος διηγήσασθαι καὶ ταῦτα πρὸς τὴν καλῶς εἰδυῖαν. καὶ μὴν οὐδὲ ἡμεῖς περισσόν τι προσιστοροῦμεν ⁑“She who kissed his knees:The two lines are athetized because it is not necessary to describe in detail piece by piece and to one who already knows these things well. And indeed we do not narrate further something superfluous.”  Line 8.95μή τις τοι φεύγοντι:τινὲς διατέλλουσιν ἐπι τῷ φεύγοντι, καὶ συνάπτωμεν δὲ ὅλον τὸν στίχον ἴσμεν ὅτι οὐ τὸ μετάφρενον φεύγει ⁑“May someone to you fleeing:Some make a distinction after the “φεύγοντι,” but let us also join the whole line. We know that a man's back does not flee.” Line 8.171σῆμα τιθεὶς Τρώεσσι·βραχὺ διασταλτέον ἐπι τὸ “Τρώεσσιν”· αὐτὸ γὰρ τὸ σημεῖον προς τὸ σημαινόμενον ὑπαντήσας εἴρηκε νίκην· ἐὰν δὲ συνάπτωμεν γίνεται σολοικοφανές ⁑“Giving the sign to the Trojans:There ought to be some short pause after “Τρώεσσιν.” Because the sign itself indicates the signal for the subsequent victory. But if we join it together, it is incorrect syntax.” Line 8.168‡ἵππους τὲ στρέψαι:ὅτι ὑποτάσσουσι. "ἢ μήτε στρέψαι μήτ' ἀντίβιον μαχέσασθαι" (Il. 8.168a) οὐκ έστιν δέ· τὸ γὰρ “διάνδιχα" (Il. 8.167) οὐκ ἐστι δύο ἐμερίμνησεν ἐναντία ἀλλ' επι τὸ αὐτὸ φερόμεθα “στρέψαι τοὺς ἵππους καὶ μάχεσθαι” ⁑“[Debating whether] to turn the horses aroundThe sign is there because it is in the subjunctive. "Neither to retreat nor to fight the enemy" (Il. 8.168a). But that is not so. For he was "of two minds" (Il. 8.167). It was not that he was worried about two different things, but that we interpret it the same: "to turn his horses and fight".” Line 8.355ἀνεκτῶς:ὡς ἀνδρικῶς Ἀρίσταρχος περισπᾶ λέλεκται δὲ ἡμῖν περι τῆς προσωδίας ὁπότε διελάβομεν περι τοῦ "ῆ δὴ λοίγια ἔργα τάδ' ἔσσεται οὐκέτ' ἀνεκτά" (Il. 1.573)“Bearably:Like ανδρικως, Aristarchus pronounces it with a circumflex, but it is said by us, regarding pronunciation, because we make a distinction regarding the [use of the word in] "ῆ δὴ λοίγια ἔργα τάδ' ἔσσεται οὐκέτ' ἀνεκτά".” Lines 8.535-8.537αὔριον ἣν ἀρετην:ὅτι ἡ τούτους δεῖ τοὺς τρεῖς στίχους μένειν οἷς τὸ ἀντίσιγμα παράκειται, ἢ τοὺς ἑξῆς τρεῖς οἷς αἱ στιγμαὶ παράκεινται  †ἢ τοὺς ἑξῆς τρεῖς† · εἰς γὰρ τὴν αὐτὴν γεγραμμένοι εἰσὶ διάνοιαν· ἐγκρίνει δὲ μᾶλλον ὁ Ἀρίσταρχος τοὺς δευτέρους δια τὸ καυχηματικωτέρους εἶναι τοὺς λόγους ὁ δε Ζηνόδοτος τοὺς πρώτους τρεῖς οὐδὲ ἔγραφεν τὰ αὐτὰ δὲ λέγει περι τῶν στίχων τούτων ὁ Δίδυμος  ἃ καὶ ὁ Ἀριστόνικος· δι ὃ οὐκ εγράψαμεν τὰ Διδύμου⁑“Tomorrow, which [will see] his excellence:The sign is there because it is necessary to keep these three lines, on which he places an anti sigma. Or the following three, on which the stigma are placed. Because they explain what the meaning is. But Aristarchus rather accepts as genuine the second three because the words are more loudly boastful. But Zenodotus accepts as genuine the first three and he does not write the second three. But regarding these lines Didymus says the same things, as does Aristonicus, for which reasons we did not write the things of Didymus.”  Lines 8.377-8.378ἠθικῶς καὶ τοῦτο πρὸς τὸ "ὁ δὲ` μαίνεται οὐκ ἔτ' ἀνεκτῶς" (Il. 8.355)· "προφανεῖσα" δὲ γράφει Ἀρίσταρχος δυϊκῶς· ὁ δὲ Ἡρωδιανὸς· "προφανείσας" βούλεται· συστέλλων Δωρικῶς τὸ "α"· ᾧ καὶ πειθόμεθα⁑“Expressively and this regarding the [line]: "one who rages beyond what can be endured" (Il. 8.355). Aristarchus writes "προφανεῖα" in the dual. But Herodian would rather "προφανείσας" contracting the alpha in the Doric dialect, by which we are also persuaded.” Line 8.178ἀβληχρά: Ἡρακλείδης ὁ Μειλήσιος βαρύνει ὡς ἄσητα. λόγῳ δὲ χρῆται τούτῳ ὡς ὅτι βληχρον ἐστι τὸ ἰσχυρόν ὅπερ κατα στέρησιν ὀφείλει λέγεσθαι "ἄβληχρος" ὡς "ἄκακος" σημαίνει γὰρ τὸ ἀσθενές . ἡ μέντοι παράδοσις ὀξύνει τὸ "ἀβληχρὰ" καὶ  "ἀβληχρὴν" (Il. 5.337) πεισθεῖσα πρῶτον τῷ παρασχηματισμῷ ὡς ἁπλῶ, οὕτως γὰρ παρεσχηματίσθη ὡς "πενιχρά" "ψυχρά" λέγω δὲ θηλυκῶς οὕτως "ἀβληχρά" οὐ κοινωνοῦντός ποτὲ τοῦ γένους· λέγω δὲ ὁ "ἀβληχρὸς" καὶ ἡ "ἀβληχρος"· ἄλλως τε ήδη αὐτὸ τὸ "βληχρὸς" σημαίνει. ὡς ἐπι τὸ πλεῖστον μᾶλλον τὸ ἀσθενές Ἀλκαῖος "θ" "βληχρῶν ἀνέμων ἀχείμαντοι πνοαί"· καὶ ὁ Νίκανδρος "βληχρὸν γὰρ μυὸς οἷα μυληβόρου ἐν χροῒ νύγμα"· τούτωι δὴ πλεονάσαν τὸ  "α" φυλάξει τὸν αὐτὸν τόνον ἀεί οἶδα γὰρ τὸ ἄβορος ἄγαυρος ἄσταχυς ⁑“Weak:Heraclides the Milesian  writes it with a grave accent on the ultima, like "ἄσητα" , and he uses this word as a stronger version of “βληχρον.” It ought to mean "not weak" like “ἄκακος” means “not evil," but it means “ἀσθενές” (“without strength”). Indeed, grammatical tradition marks it with an acute accent. “ἀβληχρὰ” and “ἀβληχρὴν” (Il. 5.337) prevailed first by declining as if it is uncompounded. For so they are declined like “πενιχρα” and “ψυχρα.” And I write it in the feminine since in this way “ἀβληχρά" does not have any common gender.  And I write "ὁ αβληχρὸς" and "ἡ ἀβληχρος." Elsewhere already “βληχρὸς" means the same thing. For the most part, since [the meaning] is ασθενες [without strength] instead. Alcaeus 8 has "βληχρῶν ἀνέμων ἀχείμαντοι πνοαί" "not stormy blasts of weak wind."  And Nicandros writes "βληχρὸν γὰρ μυὸς οἷα μυληβόρου ἐν χροῒ νύγμα" "for the weakness of the mouse was a sort of millstone-eating, like pricking on the skin."  Indeed adding the alpha to it keeps the accent in the same place. Because I know that the accent is always the same in “ἄβορος,” “ἄγαυρος,” and “ἄσταχυς."” Line 8.178ὑφ' “ἓν” τὸ "οὐδενόσωρα". εἰ καὶ σπάνιος ἡ τοιαύτη σύνθεσις· λέγω δὲ ἐξ ἀποφάσεως καὶ συνδέσμου καὶ τῆς ἑνὸς γενικῆς τελείας· τινὲς δὲ οὐδενὸς φυλακτικά· πιθανὸν δὲ καὶ τὸ ὑπογύου ἔργου μεμνῆσθαι. τῶν Ἀχαῖων τὴν πρᾶξιν ἐξευτελίζοντα·⁑From “ἓν” (“one”) "οὐδενόσωρα." Because such a compound also is rare. But I say it is [a compound] from the negation and the conjunction [i.e. δε] and from the genitive ending “ἑνὸς.” But others preserve it as “οὐδενὸς.” But it is persuasive to remember that it is a recent work [i.e. the wall], when he [Hector] is greatly disparaging the action of the Achaeans. Lines 8.188-8.190ὑμῖν παρ προτέροισιτὸ ἑξῆς τοῦτό ἐστιν "ἠ εμοὶ ὅς πέρ οἱ θαλερὸς πόσις εὔχομαι εἶναι" (190) "οἴνον τ' ἐγκεράσασα πιεῖν ὅτε" μοι "θυμὸς ἀνώγοι" (189) ἱστεον δὲ ὅτι προ τοῦ εὑρεθῆναι τὴν τῶν ποτηρίων χρῆσιν κέρασιν ἔπινον ⁑“Set before you:This is the appropriate line order in my opinion: "ἠ εμοὶ ὅς πέρ οἱ θαλερὸς πόσις εὔχομαι εἶναι" (190) then, "οἴνον τ' ἐγκεράσασα πιεῖν ὅτε θυμὸς ἀνώγοι" (189) and one must see that before being able to make use of the drinking cups they mix the drink.” Line 8.150ὥς πότ' ἀπειλήσειὅτι οὐκ εν τῷ καθόλου "εὑρεῖαν" λέγει, αλλ' εμοὶ "εὑρεῖα" ἡ γῆ γένοιτο ἀντι τοῦ "εὐρὺ χάσμα" ποιήσει ⁑“So that he may someday boast:The sign is there because in general he [the poet] does not say “εὑρεῖαν,” but in my opinion the earth would become “εὑρεῖα” instead of it making a “broad chasm.”” Line 8.150τὸ "εὐρεῖα" ἀντὶ. τοῦ "εὐρέως" κρείσσων δέ φησι θάνατος ψόγου⁑It is “εὐρεῖα” instead of “εὐρέως,” and he says that death is better than disgrace. Line 8.70πῶς δύο κῆρας ἐντίθησιν ὁ Ζεὺς ὥσπερ ἀνὰ μίαν ἑκατέρου στρατοῦ. ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἑξῆς   πλείους αὐτὰς φησιν· "αἱ μὲν Ἀχαιῶν κῆρες" (Il. 8.73)· ὅτι αἱ δύο καὶ πολλαὶ ἂν εἶεν· λέγομεν γοῦν διττὰ πράγματα· πλειόνων δὲ ἔμφασιν διδόντος τοῦ ὀνόματος, εἰκότως ἐν τῇ μεταλήψει πλέονας εἶπεν· ἔστι δὲ τὸ σχῆμα. συνεκδοχικῶν σχημάτῶν ἕν· κὴρ δὲ εἶρηται παρὰ τὸ καίω· διὰ πυρὸς γὰρ ἔθαπτοντο· εἰ δὲ τὴν ψυχὴν δηλοῖ. παρὰ τὸν κηρόν· δίκην γὰρ αὐτοῦ τὰ μαθήματα ἐν ἑαυτῇ ἀπομάττεται⁑“How does Zeus set down two fates as there is one end for each army? In these matters they say that "πλειους" is a logical arrangement of words: "αἱ μὲν Ἀχαιῶν κῆρες" (“the fates of the Achaeans”) (Il. 8.73).  Because there may be "δυο" two or "πολλαι" many. Indeed I say that matters are twofold. But others it is "πλειονων" with the noun giving emphasis. Similarly in a change of case he [the poet] said "πλεονας." It is a figure of speech, one of the measuring out together figures of speech. Death is said to be like burning. Therefore one is put to rest through fire. If it releases the soul as if it were. For one customarily searches for knowledge in oneself.” Line 8.352νῶϊἡμῖν κοινῇ διαλεκτῳ Δωριεῖς γὰρ φασὶν "ἅμμες" Αἰολεῖς "ἅμμε". Ἀττικοὶ δὲ "νῶ" Ἴωνες ἡμεάς ἔστι δὲ ἀντωνυμία δυϊκῆ ὀρθῆς καὶ αἰτιατικῆς πτώσεως ἡμῶν· καὶ ἡμῖν ⁑“It is our common dialect, because the Dorians say "ἅμμες" the Aeolians say "ἅμμε" and the Attics say "νω." The Ionians says ἡμεας, but the pronoun is dual, nominative and accusative cases, ἡμῶν and ἡμῖν.” Lines 8.233-234Τρώων ἀνθ' ἑκατόν τε:ἐπι τὴν ἄνθ’ συλλαβὴν ἡ ὀξεῖα ἵνα τὸ πλῆρες ᾖ ἄντα οὕτως δὲ ἀξιοῖ Δημήτριος ὁ Γονύπεσός. καὶ ἐμοὶ δὲ οὕτως ἀρέσκει τὸ τῆς διανοίας· ἄντικρυς γὰρ Τρώων ἑκατὸν καὶ διηκοσίων εἷς ἕκαστος στήσεσθαι φησίν. οὐ γὰρ κωλύεται ἡ τοῦ ἄντα σύνταξις εῖ γε ἐπι γενικὴν φέρεται⁑“Facing a hundred TrojansThere is an acute accent on the syllable ανθ because it is the full form αντα as Demetrios of Gonypesus correctly thought. And on my part, this way of literary interpretation is acceptable. For clearly each man says that he would make a stand against 100 or even 200 Trojans. (you need it to take the genitive because ἑκατον would be genitive if it was declinable) For the syntax of αντα is not delayed (not because it's throwing an accent back to take Trojans but because it's taking the "genitive" if εκατον were declinable), unless it takes the genitive.” Chapter Seven:Line 8.290οἱ περὶ Ζηνόδοτον καὶ Αριστοφανη "ἵππω": Zenodotus and Aristophanes and those who agree with them [write] ἵππω. Line 8.213τῶν δ' ὅσον ἐκ νηῶν ἀπο πύργου τάφρος ἔεργε:διχῶς αἱ Ἀριστάρχου· "ἔεργε" καὶ "ἔρυκε".  “The trench encloses the space all the way from the ships to the tower:The texts of Aristarchus have it two ways: "ἔεργε" and "ἔρυκε."” Line 8.296ἐκ τοῦ δὴ τόξοισι δεδεγμένος:οὕτως αἱ Ἀριστάρχου διὰ τοῦ "γ" "δεδεγμένος"· Ἡρῳδιανοῦ διὰ τοῦ "χ" "δεδεχμένος". καί φασὶ Διογένης. ἐν τοῖς ὑπομνήμασι. ὅτι “εἰρωνευόμενος” λεγει οἷον “δεξιούμενος τοῖς τόξοι”ς· τὸ γὰρ δεδέχεσθαι δεξιοῦσθαι ἐστιν οὐκ αχαρις ἡ ἐξήγησις ⁑“From that moment waiting with bows:Thus the texts of Aristarchus have δεδεγμένος with a gamma. The texts of Herodian have “δεδεχμένος” with a chi. And Diogenes says in the commentaries, that he writes “εἰρωνευόμενος” something like “δεξιούμενος τοῖς τόξοις.” Because to wait/expect is to welcome not without charm or explanation.” Line 8.513‡ἀλλ' ὥς τις τούτον  γε βέλοςὅτι "βέλος" εἴρηκε τὸ τρᾶμα ὁμωνύμως τῷ τιτρώσκοντι. αἱ Ἀριστοφάνους "πέσσοι"·  Παρμενίσκος δὲ ἐν τῷ α Πρὸς Κράτητα  ὡς Ἀριστάρχειον γραφὴν προφέρεται, "ἀλλ ὥς τις κείνων γε"⁑“But so that some missile:The sign is there because he said the weapon to indicate the wound, it being a homonym for wounding. The texts of Aristophanes have πέσσοι. And Parmeniscus  in Book One of Regarding Dominance, like the Aristarchean writing, has "ἀλλ ὥς τις κείνων γε."” Line 8.304Ἀρίσταρχος "Αἱσύμνηθεν" καὶ ἡ Ζηνοδοτου καὶ ἡ Ἀριστοφανους“Aristarchus writes “Αἱσύμνηθεν” as does the text of Zenodotus and the text of Aristophanes.”  Line 8.405ἕλκε ἀπαλθήσεσθονἐν τῇ ἑτέρα τῶν Ἀριστάρχου "ἕλκε ἀπαλθήσονται" καὶ μήποτε κρείττων τὰ ἕλκη ἀπαλθήσονται ⁑“They shall thoroughly heal the wounds:In the other [text] of Aristarchus it is "ἕλκε ἀπαλθήσονται" and there never is the superior form: "ἕλκη ἀπαλθήσονται."”  Line 8.166‡ εν τῇ Ζηνοδοτου "ποτμον ἐφήσω"⁑ “In the text of Zendotos [it is] "ποτμον ἐφήσω."” Line 8.56παυρότεροι:ὅτι ἐλάσσους ἀεὶ τοὺς Τρῶας συν τοῖς ἐπικούροις λέγει ἡ δε ἀναφορὰ πρὸς ἐκεῖνα τὰ ἀθετούμενα, "πολλεων ἐκ πολίων ἐγχέσπαλοι ἄνδρες" (Il. 2.131)· καὶ πρὸς Ζηνόδοτον γράφοντα,· "μυρία δ' ἐν πεδίω"  ⁑“SmallerThe sign is there because he [the poet] always says the Trojans with their allies are a smaller group. And the repetition with respect to those athetized lines, for example "πολλεων ἐκ πολίων ἐχξέσπαλοι ἄνδρες" (Il. 2.131) as opposed to the work of Zenodotus "μυρία δ’ ἐν πεδίω".” Line 8.284καί σε νόθον περ ἑόντα:παρα Ζηνοδότω, οὐδε ἢν· ἠθέτητο δὲ καὶ παρα Ἀριστοφάνει ὅτι ἄκαιρος ἡ γενεαλογία καὶ οὐκ έχουσα προτροπὴν ἀλλα τοῦναντίον ὀνειδισμὸν καὶ ἀποτροπήν ⁑“And indeed you being a bastard:In Zenodotus,  the line was not there. And it is athetized in Aristophanes because the family history is inappropriate and does not suit an exhortation but rather is a reproach and a dissuasion [from action].”  Line 8.557ἔκ τ' ἔφανεν πᾶσαι:ἀθετεῖται ὅτι οἰκειότερον ἔχει κατὰ τὴν Πατρόκλου ἐπιφάνειαν·  καὶ ὁ ἑξῆς  δὲ συναθετεῖται αὐτῷ ἐκεῖ γὰρ αἰφνίδιον βούλεται ἐπίλαμψιν παραστῆσαι αἰφνιδίως Πατρόκλου ἐπιφανέντος· ἐνταῦθα δὲ παρατεταμένην νηνεμίην κατ' εὐδίαν· οὐκ εφέροντο δὲ οὐδὲ παρα Ζηνοδότῳ. ἠθέτει δὲ καὶ Ἀριστοφάνης ⁑“From which everything is seen:The line is athetized because it is rather similar to the looking down on Patroclus. And what follows is athetized along with it because he wishes to stand there suddenly illuminated, so that Patroclus may be viewed suddenly. But there the stillness is stretched out for tranquility. It is not transmitted in Zenodotus's edition. And Aristophanes also athetized it.” Line 8.371ουδὲ παρὰ Ζηνοδότω ῆσαν ⁑ “The lines were not in Zenodotus's edition.” Line 8.337Ἔκτωρ δ' ἐν πρώτοισι:αἱ Ἀριστάρχου χωρὶς τοῦ "ν" "Ἕκτωρ δὲ πρώτοισι"· καὶ ἔστιν ὁ δὲ Ἕκτωρ ἐπι τοὺς πρώτους ὥρμα ⁑“Hector among the first:The texts of Aristarchus have it without the nu and it is: "Ἕκτωρ δὲ πρώτοισι." Hector was hastening on at the front lines.” Line 8.157ουτως δια τοῦ "α" "τραπε" αἱ Ἀριστάρχου“The texts of Aristarchus have it this way: "τραπε" with the alpha.” Conclusions:Line 8.527κήρεσσι φορήτουςσυνθέτως ἀνέγνω ὁ Ἀρίσταρχος καὶ οἱ πλείους ἴσως δὲ ἐπεὶ ἀναλύει αὐτὸ "οὒς κῆρες φορέουσιν" (Il. 8.528) ἔθος γὰρ αὐτῷ πολλάκις τὰ σύνθετα ἀναλύειν. οὐδέποτε δὲ δοτικῇ ἐπεκτεταμένη, κατ αρχὴν συντέθειται οἶον πᾶσι καὶ πάντεσσι· "πασιμέλουσα" (Od. 12.70), οὐχὶ παρα τὴν πάντεσσι ἡ σύνθεσις "Ναυσικάα" "Ναυσίθοος", "ἐγχεσίμοροι" "τειχεσιπλήτης". κατ αρχὴν δὲ προσέθηκα, διὰ τὸ παρ'  Ἐπιχάρμῳ  κατα τέλος συντεθειμένον "γυναικ’ ἄνδρεσσι ποθεινοί"· εἴπερ οὖν τοῦτο ἀληθὲς. δηλονότι παράλογον, τὸ "κηρεσσιφορήτους" κατα σύνθεσιν ἀναγνωστέον, ἀλλ ὅμως ἐπεκράτησεν ἡ Ἀριστάρχειος δι ὃν εἴπομεν λόγον ⁑“Urged on the Fates:Aristarchus read it well as a compound, and the majority likewise also when he resolves it into its elements it: "οὒς κῆρες φορέουσιν" (Il. 8.528). Because it is customary for him to resolve the compound often. But never lengthening out the syllable in the dative, at the beginning it is compounded like “πασι” and “πάντεσσι” in "παειμέλουσα" (Od. 12.70).  The compound is not only derived from from “πάντεσσι,” [for example] "Ναυσικάα" "Ναυσίθοος", "ἐγχεσίμοροι" "τειχεσιπλήτης." I placed it at the beginning, according to the [argument] from Epicharmos, and I compound it at the end like "γυναικ’ ἄνδρεσσι ποθεινοί." Indeed if that is true it is clear that it is contrary to the rule. The “κηρεσσιφορήτους” must be read as a compound, but nevertheless the Aristarchean edition is the authority according which logic we say it.” Line 8.114ἐν σχήματι ἐδήλωσε τὸ δοκοῦν παραλελεῖφθαι· οὐ γὰρ εἴρηκεν ἀνωτέρω ποῖοι ἦσαν οἱ θεράποντες· φασὶ δὲ τὸν Σθένελον ἀπὸ τοῦ τείχους κατενεχθέντα τρωθῆναι τὸ σκέλος δια τοῦτο οὐ πολεμεῖ ἀλλ’ ἡνιοχεῖ Διομήδει⁑In the line he has shown that is expected that he be left behind. For he has not said previously/above where the charioteers were. They say that Sthenelos having been brought down from the walls was wounded with respect to his leg and because of this he did not fight but rather held the reins for Diomedes.

# Appendix 2 #

As mentioned above, one of the principles upon which the Homer Multitext project prides itself is providing immediate verification for its editions. Since my editions are far from being published outside this thesis, that instant verification is not possible. Ideally when my editions are published, a user of the edition would be able to show or hide the text, the scholia, and the corresponding images. In order to allow for verification, I have provided below the cited images for every scholion that appears in Appendix 1, in the order that they appear in Appendix 1. These URN cited images can be plugged into the HMT image citation tool [here](http://www.homermultitext.org/hmt-digital/svcforms) under 'find links to an image'.
