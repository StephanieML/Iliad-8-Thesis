# Athetization #

One of the myriad of subjects addressed in the scholia and the related materials is athetization. The Venetus A, which is accompanied by the critical signs of Aristarchus, notes lines athetized by Zenodotus with an !{obelus}[obelus]. Many of the Aristarchean readings noted in the scholia frequently reference their Zenodotean precedencts because Aristarchus was was a pupil of Zenodotus. Aristophanes predated both scholars, so the chronological progression begins with Aristophanes and ends with Aristarchus.

Aristophanes and Zenodotus were known athetizers, dedicated to eliminating repeating lines, which we know to be part of oral-traditional poetry, and language that was otherwise confusing or illogical. Aristarchus, similarly dedicated to producing such an *Iliad* nevertheless took a different approach. Many of the readings Aristophanes and Zenodotus considered spurious were preserved in Aristarchus's commentaries on the *Iliad* and so have been passed down to us in the scholia. 
	
The scholia that discuss the athetization practices of Aristophanes and Zenodotus reflect patterns in tense and topic which merit a systematic survey and consideration.

## Aristophanes ##

In Book 8 of the Venetus A, there are ten occurences, <code concordion:set="#urn">urn:cite:hmt:pers.pers21</code>, of the name <strong concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">Aristophanes</strong>.

Three of those occurences, <code concordion:set="#urn">urn:cite:hmt:pers.pers21</code>, are in the <strong concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">nominative singular</strong>.

Each of those three occurences, <code concordion:set="#urn">urns</code>, are accompanied by the verb <strong concordion:assertEquals="getPhrase(#urn)">ἀθετέω</strong>.

Each of those three occurences, <code concordion:set="#urn">urns</code>, are in a <strong concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">imperfect tense</strong>.

As chronologically the first scholar in the Aristophanes-Zenodotus-Aristarchus trio, the use of the imperfect tense in conjunction with his name can inform our interpretation of sources of these scholia and how the ancient scholars discussed athetization of Homeric lines. The patterns apparent in the scholia that cite Zenodotus may shed further light on these interpretations.

## Zenodotus ##

In Book 8 of the Venetus A, there are thirty occurences, <code concordion:set="#urn">urn:cite:hmt:pers.pers15</code>, of the name <strong concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">Zenodotus</strong>.

Twenty-three of those occurences, <code concordion:set="#urn">urn:cite:hmt:pers.pers15</code>, are in the <strong concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">nominative singular</strong>.

One of those occurences, <code concordion:set="#urn">urns</code> is accompanied by the verb <strong concordion:assertEquals="getPhrase(#urn)">ἀθετέω</strong>.

This occurence, <code concordion:set="#urn">urn</code>, is in a <strong concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">imperfect tense</strong>.

Zenodotus, like Aristarchus, frequently appears with the verb γράφω. Fifteen of nominative singular occurences of the name Zenodotus, <code concordion:set="#urn">urns</code>, are accompanied by the verb <strong concordion:assertEquals="getPhrase(#urn)">γράφω</strong>.

Three of those occurences,  <code concordion:set="#urn">urns</code>, are in a <strong concordion:assertEquals="getTokens(#urn)">imperfect tense</strong>.

## Interpreting the Data ##

Since Aristophanes is the first of the three scholars, the imperfect tense appearing in conjunction with his name indicates that the source of the Venetus A scholia on Aristophanes had the scholar's work and viewed it as a past event. This point of view indicates that these scholia were composed long after Aristophanes. That Aristarchus and Zenodotus appear in conjunction with present tense verbs indicates that the source of those scholia considered them more contemporaneously. 

However, all of the Aristophanes scholia that use the imperfect tense, also use the verb ἀθετέω, which means "to athetize." It is not possible to conclude simply from the Aristophean evidence that the imperfect tense is used for athetization. 

Zenodotus, the other major athetizer, also appears in conjunction with the verb ἀθετέω in Book 8 and this verb too is in the imperfect tense. Zenodotus also frequently appears with the verb γράφω, but these occurences are not always in the same tense. The majority of these occurences are in the present tense, but a small percentage appear in the imperfect. This evidence indicates several possible solutions.

The first solution is that athetization is exclusively discussed in the imperfect tense. There are no counter examples in the texts of Book 8. The second solution is that the imperfect tense reflects the point of view of the sources of the scholia. Aristophanes is considered solidly in the past and therefore exlusively refered to in the imperfect tense. Zenodotus, being the intermediary between Aristophanes and Aristarchus is sometimes refered to in the past tense but largely refered to in the present tense.
