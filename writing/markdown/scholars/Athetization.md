# Athetization #

## Aristophanes ##

In Book 8 of the Venetus A, <strong concordion:assertEquals="getPhrase(#urn)">Aristophanes</strong> appears ten times <code concordion:set="#urn">urn:cite:hmt:pers.pers21</code>. 

Three of those occurences, <code concordion:set="#urn">urn:cite:hmt:pers.pers21</code>, are in the <strong concordion:assertEquals="getPhrase(#urn)">nominative singular</strong>.

Each of those three occurences, <code concordion:set="#urn">urns</code>, are accompanied by the verb <strong concordion:assertEquals="getPhrase(#urn)">ἀθετέω</strong>, which means "to athetize".

Each of those three occurences, <code concordion:set="#urn">urns</code>, are in the <strong concordion:assertEquals="getPhrase(#urn)">past tense</strong>.

As chronologically the first scholar in the Aristophanes-Zenodotus-Aristarchus trio, the use of the past tense in conjunction with his name can inform our interpretation of sources of these scholia.
