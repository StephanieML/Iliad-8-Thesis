# The Works of Ancient Scholars #

One ambiguity of reference to the works of the ancient Homeric scholars is the use of the feminine article, in particular the use of the plural feminine article in conjunction with the genitive singular of the scholar's name. The most notable of these is Aristarchus, who is widely talked about by Nagy, West, and their predecessors. The popular theory is that the feminine article implies the nouns ἔκδοσεις or διόρθωσις, which would could translate as "text" or "edition." However, as Nagy appropriately notes in his discussion on the debate, we cannot consider an ἔκδοσεις or a διόρθωσις an edition by our modern definitions of what entails an edition. We cannot assume that Aristarchus was writing his edition of the *Iliad* with any of our modern notions of textual criticism although we can attribute the distant origin of our notions to the larger movement of the Alexandrian scholars. If we take the word implied by the feminine article to be ἔκδοσεις or διόρθωσις, then its plurality indicates, as many scholars have noted, indicates that any scholar who appears in this construction wrote multiple editions of the *Iliad*. However, the debate has centered largely around Aristarchus due to his monumental influence upon the Homeric scholia. With the ability to automate searches in a digital, diplomatic edition, I was able to run a systematic search through the scholia of *Iliad* 8 in both the Venetus A and the Y.I.1 to determine whether Aristarchus is the only such scholar. The evidence reveals he is not. 

Aristophanes, a scholar two generations Aristarchus's senior, is cited in scholion <code concordion:set="#urn">urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026.msA.hmt:8.321</code> on line 513, which reads <strong concordion:assertEquals="getPhrase(#urn)">αἱ Ἀριστοφάνους</strong>. While this is the clearest example of another scholar with the plural feminine article, a case can be made for Herodian in scholion <code concordion:set="#urn">urn:cts:greekLit:tlg5026msA.hmt:8.199</code> on line 8.296, which reads <strong concordion:assertEquals="getPhrase(#urn)">οὕτως αἱ Ἀριστάρχου διὰ τοῦ γ δεδεγμένος· Ἡρῳδιανοῦ διὰ τοῦ χ δεδεχμένος</strong>. In this case, we have to assume a parallel construction with "αἱ Ἀριστάρχου" and "Ἡρῳδιανοῦ". Unfortunately the compressed nature of scholia provides few contexts clues as to the expanded version of the second part of the sentence.
