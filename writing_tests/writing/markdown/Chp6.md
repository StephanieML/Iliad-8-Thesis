# Chapter Six: Scholia Using the First Person Part Two #

The other first person scholia I investigated fit together in a nebulous fashion, which gave me great difficulty as I attempted to classify them. I found that even where I could distinguish categorically distinct uses of the first person, the scholia often used a combination of the different types. Scholia that did not use the first person in speeches used the first person to mean one or more of the following groups: “I” as in a specific editor or scholar, “we” as in a group of editors or scholars, or “we” as the collective Greek-speaking, Hellenistic people. I will take a look at the scholia I read, distinguishing the groups as much as is permissible, starting with the most general of these scholia: the scholia that use “we” to refer to a collective Greek people.	
The first of these scholia in the Venetus A refers to line 8.429. In this section, after Zeus prevents Hera and Athena from aiding the Greeks, Hera declares that it is not worth waging war against Zeus so it is better to let circumstances unfold naturally with either the Greeks or the Trojans slaying the other and achieving victory. It would appear that Hera’s sudden change of heart, on a topic she so vehemently debated, unsettled scholiasts, for the scholion in the Venetus A reads:+ τῶν· αλλος μὲν ἀποφθείσθω·ὅταν εἰς τὴν ἀξίαν ἀτενίση. τῶν θεῶν· τότε φασὶν αὐτοὺς μὴ κινεῖσθαι τῆ περι θνητῶν ὡς οὐδε ἂν ἡμεῖς περι μυρμήκων· ὅταν δὲ ἐπιλογίσηται τὴν ποιητικήν ἕπεται τοῖς μύθοις καὶ τὴν ὑπόθεσιν ἐκτραγωδεῖ συμμαχίας καὶ θεομαχίας παραγων “Let one of them perish:Whenever he [the poet] is looking at the reputation of the gods, then he says they would not be moved by anything concerning mortals. Just as we would not be moved concerning ants. But whenever he considers poetry, he follows the stories and makes the subject famous: bringing about alliances and wars among gods.”  Barring a few differences in punctuation and accentation, the comparable scholion in the Y.1.1 is verbatim the same. It reads:ὅτ’ ἂν εἰς τὴν ἀξίαν ἀτενίσῃ τῶν θεῶν, τότε φησὶν αὐτοὺς μὴ κινεῖσθαι περὶ θνητῶν· ὡς οὐδὲ ἂν ἡμεῖς περὶ μυρμήκων· ὅτ’ ἂν δὲ ἐπιλογίσηται τὴν ποιητικὴν, ἕπεται τοῖς μύθοις καὶ τὴν ὑπόθεσιν ἐκτραγωδεῖ. συμμαχίας καὶ θεομαχίας παράγων⁑“Whenever he [the poet] is looking at the reputation of the gods, then he says they would not be moved by anything concerning mortals. Just as we would not be moved concerning ants. But whenever he considers poetry, he follows the stories and makes the subject famous: bringing about alliances and wars among gods.” This scholion, without a doubt, uses the first person plural to refer to humankind in general. Humankind should understand the disinterest of the gods as similar to the ambivalence of humans towards inferior creatures like ants. The second half of these scholia sheds light on how the Homeric scholars viewed the tradition of epic poetry. The first argument in the scholia explains why Hera appears to lose interest so easily. The second part explains that she does not lose interest for long. Even if humans are as interesting as ants, she and the other gods display a great deal of vested interest in the affairs of humankind in the Iliad and in other works of Greek literature. It would seem that the Homeric scholars viewed the emphasis on the gods’ involvement in the affairs of humans in epic poetry as unrealistic but entertaining fantasy. It is the will of the poet that makes the gods act with such extraordinary attention to human affairs. The phrase τὴν ὑπόθεσιν ἐκταγωδεῖ, which I have translated after much deliberation as “he makes the subject famous,” indicates that the composition of themes and stories in the Homeric epics are popular because the poet creates drama amongst the gods. We could compare it to the way the Greeks and Romans were fascinated by the lives of eminent men more powerful than they. Humankind on the whole is fascinated by the gods, beings more powerful and to a large extent unfathomable. The mystery in their behavior makes for good story-telling. 	
Some of the first person plural scholia blur the line between the audience and the author. For instance the first person plurals in a scholion of the Venetus A on line 8.284, can be interpreted as the collective audience, collective scholarly opinion, or both. Discussing Teucer’s lineage and his status as a bastard, the scholion reads:Ἡρακλῆς πορθήσας Ἴ¨λιον Ἰσιώνηντὴν Λαομέδοντος θυγατέρα Πριαμου δὲ ἀδελφὴν ἔλαβεν αἰχμάλωτον καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῇ γέρας Τελαμῶνι ὡς συστρατεύσαντι αὐτῷ ἀφ ῆς ἔσχε Τευκρον ὁ Τελαμών ὡς οὖν ἀπο Τρωϊκῆς γυναικὸς τεχθέντα τὸν παῖδα  Τεῦκρον ἐκάλεσαν προ ἀναπέμψαντες τὸν τόνον καὶ ποιήσαντες κύριον.  Τευκροῖ γὰρ οἱ  Τρῶες  ἀπο τοῦ βασιλεύοντος αὐτῶν  Τεύκρου. ἡ δὲ ἱστορία ἀκριβέστερον εἴρηται παρά τε ἄλλοις πολλοῖς καὶ παρα Ἀπολλωνίω τῷ γραμματικῷ ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ τῶν γενῶν· ἐζήτηται δὲ πῶς ἐξ απάντων ἐπαινέσας τὸν Τεῦκρον νῦν ἐπιφέρει νόθον· ἡμεῖς δὲ φαμὲν τοῦτο μὴ εῖναι πρὸς αἰσχύνης. δια τὸ παρα τοῖς παλαιοῖς ἔθος κρατοῦν, ἑτίμων γὰρ τοὺς νόθους ἐπ ἴσης τοῖς γνησίοις· ἄλλως τε· εἰ καὶ αἰχμάλωτος ἡ ἰσιώνη, ἀλλα βασιλίς· ἔτι δὲ καὶ αὐξήσεως ἕνεκεν τοῦτο εἰρῆσθαι φαμεν ὅτι τῇ ἀρετῇ· καὶ τοὺς γνησίους ὑπερέβαλεν⁑“Heracles:Heracles laid waste to windy Ilium and he took captive the daughter of Laomedon and sister of Priam and gave her as a gift to Telemon since he joined him on the expedition. From her, Telemon had Teucer. Since he brought into the world by a Trojan woman, he called the child Teucer, moving the accent back and making it a proper noun. For the Trojans were called the Teucrians from their king Teucer. The story is more precisely told by many others and by Apollonius the grammarian in the second generation. It is asked how having received praise from everyone Teucer is now a bastard. We say that it was not a cause for dishonor. Because the custom of the ancients prevails. For they honored bastards equally with legitimate children. And otherwise if someone was a spearman or a commoner but a royal. And on account of the magnification, we say that this is said for excellence that he surpasses the legitimate children.” Because the speaker in this scholion is citing other scholars, one of whom is explicitly named, it is quite possible that the “we” in this scholion indicates a collective scholarly opinion, the speaker agreeing with the sources he consulted. However, the scholion is also talking about issues of Greek culture and popular opinion, making it quite likely that the “we” refers to a Greek collective whole. 	
Another ambiguous scholion can be found in the Venetus A on lines 8.371-8.372. In these lines, after Hera appeals to Athena to aid the dying Greeks, Athena expresses her dissatisfaction with Zeus’s order for the gods to abstain from helping the Greeks. These particular lines recount Thetis’s request of Zeus in Book 1 when she asked Zeus to give Achilles glory. One scholiast felt it was superfluous for Athena to recount the story, especially to Hera who knows it perfectly well and so the scholion reads:ἥ οἱ γούνατ' ἔκυσσε:ἀθετοῦνται δύο στίχοι ὅτι οὐκ έδει κατὰ μερος διηγήσασθαι καὶ ταῦτα πρὸς τὴν καλῶς εἰδυῖαν. καὶ μὴν οὐδὲ ἡμεῖς περισσόν τι προσιστοροῦμεν ⁑“She who kissed his knees:The two lines are athetized because it is not necessary to describe in detail piece by piece and to one who already knows these things well. And indeed we do not narrate further something superfluous.”  This scholion leaves open several possibilities for the mysterious first person plural. One option is that the scholiast is talking about general good practices of story-telling. It is not good form to be repetitive or continue to narrate something that has already been explained at length. Conversely this philosophy would mean that the good reader or listener would be expected to remember everything that was said, even seven books of poetry later. Another option is to interpret the “we” in a far more limited sense. This “we” could refer to the Homeric scholars themselves. The scholiast could be talking about a generally agreed upon standard accepted by most Homeric scholars not to over-narrate an event that has been brought up previously. This interpretation, if it is correct, reflects the basic intentions of the ancient Homeric scholars as they sought to regularize and interpret their editions of the Iliad. A further limitation on this interpretation of the first person plural could narrow it down to two individuals, the author of this particular scholion and a source with which he agrees. 	
Other scholia are much easier to interpret. For example, there are two first person plural scholia in the Venetus A, which use the verb συνάπτωμεν. In these scholia the verb appears to indicate a preference for joining multiple lines together. The first scholion appears on line 8.95, where Diomedes laments that Hector will call him a coward if he retreats. The scholion reads:μή τις τοι φεύγοντι:τινὲς διατέλλουσιν ἐπι τῷ φεύγοντι, καὶ συνάπτωμεν δὲ ὅλον τὸν στίχον ἴσμεν ὅτι οὐ τὸ μετάφρενον φεύγει ⁑“May someone to you fleeing:Some make a distinction after the “φεύγοντι,” but let us also join the whole line. We know that a man's back does not flee.” Here the issue is punctuation for clarity. Some sources, otherwise unattributed, believe that a punctuation mark of some kind, probably a comma by our modern standards, should be present after φεύγοντι to make it clear that it is the entire man fleeing and not his back. συνάπτωμεν seems to be a collective we that includes the readers and the scholiast. ἴσμεν is also a first person plural and could be the same “we” as συνάπτωμεν but might also be just the readers.	
The second scholion appears on line 8.171, where Zeus thunders three times to indicate that the Trojans are closer to victory, which causes the Greeks to retreat towards their ships. The scholion reads:σῆμα τιθεὶς Τρώεσσι·βραχὺ διασταλτέον ἐπι τὸ “Τρώεσσιν”· αὐτὸ γὰρ τὸ σημεῖον προς τὸ σημαινόμενον ὑπαντήσας εἴρηκε νίκην· ἐὰν δὲ συνάπτωμεν γίνεται σολοικοφανές ⁑“Giving the sign to the Trojans:There ought to be some short pause after “Τρώεσσιν.” Because the sign itself indicates the signal for the subsequent victory. But if we join it together, it is incorrect syntax.” Again the scholiast discusses punctuation, this time arguing that it should be present. Here the collective “we” would appear to refer to scholiasts. It is unclear whether this is the “royal we” or whether the scholiast is perhaps referring a source with which he agrees. 	
Other first person plurals speak to issues of interpretation and clarity. The Venetus A has a scholion on line 8.168, where Diomedes is debating whether to face Hector or retreat. The scholion reads:‡ἵππους τὲ στρέψαι:ὅτι ὑποτάσσουσι. "ἢ μήτε στρέψαι μήτ' ἀντίβιον μαχέσασθαι" (Il. 8.168a) οὐκ έστιν δέ· τὸ γὰρ “διάνδιχα" (Il. 8.167) οὐκ ἐστι δύο ἐμερίμνησεν ἐναντία ἀλλ' επι τὸ αὐτὸ φερόμεθα “στρέψαι τοὺς ἵππους καὶ μάχεσθαι” ⁑“[Debating whether] to turn the horses aroundThe sign is there because it is in the subjunctive. "Neither to retreat nor to fight the enemy" (Il. 8.168a). But that is not so. For he was "of two minds" (Il. 8.167). It was not that he was worried about two different things, but that we interpret it the same: "to turn his horses and fight".” Here the speaker is almost definitely consulting more than one source. It seems a likely explanation that the scholiast consulted a source, agreed with this unnamed source, and unfortunately we have lost the knowledge of what this source was.	
Other scholia of this type are similarly unclear. A scholion on line 8.355 of the Venetus A cites a disagreement with the scholar Aristarchus, but we have little idea of who the disagreers are other than that they must be writing subsequent to the works of Aristarchus to cite him by name and disagree with him. The scholion reads:ἀνεκτῶς:ὡς ἀνδρικῶς Ἀρίσταρχος περισπᾶ λέλεκται δὲ ἡμῖν περι τῆς προσωδίας ὁπότε διελάβομεν περι τοῦ "ῆ δὴ λοίγια ἔργα τάδ' ἔσσεται οὐκέτ' ἀνεκτά" (Il. 1.573)“Bearably:Like ανδρικως, Aristarchus pronounces it with a circumflex, but it is said by us, regarding pronunciation, because we make a distinction regarding the [use of the word in] "ῆ δὴ λοίγια ἔργα τάδ' ἔσσεται οὐκέτ' ἀνεκτά".” Some of the scholia offer a better insight into the goals of the mystery first person plural commentators. A scholion of the Venetus A and a scholion of the Y.1.1 offer thoughts on the works these commentators produced. We should be careful, however, not to assume that the two scholia refer to the same individuals, especially because these notes are coming from two different manuscripts, but also because we can never be truly sure. The first of these scholia comments on lines 8.535-8.537 and reads:αὔριον ἣν ἀρετην:ὅτι ἡ τούτους δεῖ τοὺς τρεῖς στίχους μένειν οἷς τὸ ἀντίσιγμα παράκειται, ἢ τοὺς ἑξῆς τρεῖς οἷς αἱ στιγμαὶ παράκεινται  †ἢ τοὺς ἑξῆς τρεῖς† · εἰς γὰρ τὴν αὐτὴν γεγραμμένοι εἰσὶ διάνοιαν· ἐγκρίνει δὲ μᾶλλον ὁ Ἀρίσταρχος τοὺς δευτέρους δια τὸ καυχηματικωτέρους εἶναι τοὺς λόγους ὁ δε Ζηνόδοτος τοὺς πρώτους τρεῖς οὐδὲ ἔγραφεν τὰ αὐτὰ δὲ λέγει περι τῶν στίχων τούτων ὁ Δίδυμος  ἃ καὶ ὁ Ἀριστόνικος· δι ὃ οὐκ εγράψαμεν τὰ Διδύμου⁑“Tomorrow, which [will see] his excellence:The sign is there because it is necessary to keep these three lines, on which he places an anti sigma. Or the following three, on which the stigma are placed. Because they explain what the meaning is. But Aristarchus rather accepts as genuine the second three because the words are more loudly boastful. But Zenodotus accepts as genuine the first three and he does not write the second three. But regarding these lines Didymus says the same things, as does Aristonicus, for which reasons we did not write the things of Didymus.”  Whoever the first person plural is in this scholion, it is clear that they are working with different editions of the Iliad and making judgments about what text to represent in a new edition. This edition is coming after Zenodotus, Aristarchus, Aristonicus, and Didymus and its compiler had access to their works. How far back should we attempt to date this commentary? Is it the next generation of scholars after these named men or is it a later comment, possibly even from the scribe of the Venetus A? We will certainly not be able to tell from a single scholion. 	
The scholion in the Y.1.1 similarly discusses variant readings. This scholion refers to line 8.377-8.378 and reads:ἠθικῶς καὶ τοῦτο πρὸς τὸ "ὁ δὲ` μαίνεται οὐκ ἔτ' ἀνεκτῶς" (Il. 8.355)· "προφανεῖσα" δὲ γράφει Ἀρίσταρχος δυϊκῶς· ὁ δὲ Ἡρωδιανὸς· "προφανείσας" βούλεται· συστέλλων Δωρικῶς τὸ "α"· ᾧ καὶ πειθόμεθα⁑“Expressively and this regarding the [line]: "one who rages beyond what can be endured" (Il. 8.355). Aristarchus writes "προφανεῖα" in the dual. But Herodian would rather "προφανείσας" contracting the alpha in the Doric dialect, by which we are also persuaded.” The poetic text in this manuscript reads προγανείσας, corresponding to the version of the text this scholion prefers. Therefore it is possible that the “we” of this scholion refers to the scribe or scribes who assembled the Y.1.1 or their preferred source. These scholia certainly need more work and, like many of the issues I investigated, will benefit from a broader range of data to draw from.	
Finally, there are first person singular scholia that appear to cite a particular editor’s or scholar’s opinion on the text. Most of the scholia I was able to read come from the Venetus A, one of the first of which refers to line 8.178, where in a speech to the Trojans, Hector calls the temporary walls the Greeks built around their ships weak and ineffective. The scholion reads:ἀβληχρά: Ἡρακλείδης ὁ Μειλήσιος βαρύνει ὡς ἄσητα. λόγῳ δὲ χρῆται τούτῳ ὡς ὅτι βληχρον ἐστι τὸ ἰσχυρόν ὅπερ κατα στέρησιν ὀφείλει λέγεσθαι "ἄβληχρος" ὡς "ἄκακος" σημαίνει γὰρ τὸ ἀσθενές . ἡ μέντοι παράδοσις ὀξύνει τὸ "ἀβληχρὰ" καὶ  "ἀβληχρὴν" (Il. 5.337) πεισθεῖσα πρῶτον τῷ παρασχηματισμῷ ὡς ἁπλῶ, οὕτως γὰρ παρεσχηματίσθη ὡς "πενιχρά" "ψυχρά" λέγω δὲ θηλυκῶς οὕτως "ἀβληχρά" οὐ κοινωνοῦντός ποτὲ τοῦ γένους· λέγω δὲ ὁ "ἀβληχρὸς" καὶ ἡ "ἀβληχρος"· ἄλλως τε ήδη αὐτὸ τὸ "βληχρὸς" σημαίνει. ὡς ἐπι τὸ πλεῖστον μᾶλλον τὸ ἀσθενές Ἀλκαῖος "θ" "βληχρῶν ἀνέμων ἀχείμαντοι πνοαί"· καὶ ὁ Νίκανδρος "βληχρὸν γὰρ μυὸς οἷα μυληβόρου ἐν χροῒ νύγμα"· τούτωι δὴ πλεονάσαν τὸ  "α" φυλάξει τὸν αὐτὸν τόνον ἀεί οἶδα γὰρ τὸ ἄβορος ἄγαυρος ἄσταχυς ⁑“Weak:Heraclides the Milesian  writes it with a grave accent on the ultima, like "ἄσητα" , and he uses this word as a stronger version of “βληχρον.” It ought to mean "not weak" like “ἄκακος” means “not evil," but it means “ἀσθενές” (“without strength”). Indeed, grammatical tradition marks it with an acute accent. “ἀβληχρὰ” and “ἀβληχρὴν” (Il. 5.337) prevailed first by declining as if it is uncompounded. For so they are declined like “πενιχρα” and “ψυχρα.” And I write it in the feminine since in this way “ἀβληχρά" does not have any common gender.  And I write "ὁ αβληχρὸς" and "ἡ ἀβληχρος." Elsewhere already “βληχρὸς" means the same thing. For the most part, since [the meaning] is ασθενες [without strength] instead. Alcaeus 8 has "βληχρῶν ἀνέμων ἀχείμαντοι πνοαί" "not stormy blasts of weak wind."  And Nicandros writes "βληχρὸν γὰρ μυὸς οἷα μυληβόρου ἐν χροῒ νύγμα" "for the weakness of the mouse was a sort of millstone-eating, like pricking on the skin."  Indeed adding the alpha to it keeps the accent in the same place. Because I know that the accent is always the same in “ἄβορος,” “ἄγαυρος,” and “ἄσταχυς."” The scholion discusses the issues of accenting and deciphering the meaning of ἀβληχρ’ in line 8.178. Everything is thrown into question by the presence of the initial alpha and whether it is an alpha-privative or an intensifier. What we can tell so far about the mysterious first person commentator, is that he uses verbs like λέγω and οἶδα, he comments on issues of accentation and meaning, and he had at his disposal other editions of Iliad (namely one by a certain Heraclides) and a knowledge of Greek poetry besides the Homeric epics to quote.	
The issue gets even more intriguing when we look at the Y.1.1. This manuscript too has a scholion on line 8.178, but instead of commenting on ἀβλαχρ’ this scholion comments on οὐδενόσωρα. The scholion reads:ὑφ' “ἓν” τὸ "οὐδενόσωρα". εἰ καὶ σπάνιος ἡ τοιαύτη σύνθεσις· λέγω δὲ ἐξ ἀποφάσεως καὶ συνδέσμου καὶ τῆς ἑνὸς γενικῆς τελείας· τινὲς δὲ οὐδενὸς φυλακτικά· πιθανὸν δὲ καὶ τὸ ὑπογύου ἔργου μεμνῆσθαι. τῶν Ἀχαῖων τὴν πρᾶξιν ἐξευτελίζοντα·⁑From “ἓν” (“one”) "οὐδενόσωρα." Because such a compound also is rare. But I say it is [a compound] from the negation and the conjunction [i.e. δε] and from the genitive ending “ἑνὸς.” But others preserve it as “οὐδενὸς.” But it is persuasive to remember that it is a recent work [i.e. the wall], when he [Hector] is greatly disparaging the action of the Achaeans. It is tempting to think that the authors of these two scholia are the same person, but we must keep in mind that this scholion appears in a different manuscript from the first one and nothing is attested about οὐδενόσωρα in the Venetus A. Still, this scholion uses the same verb λέγω and has a similar preoccupation with analyzing the components of the word. This scholion treads more in the realm of etymology than the Venetus A scholion, but it is highly believable that this scholion hails from the same source as the Venetus A scholion on this line. It is possible that there was a single source that discussed these types of inquiries and the scribes selected different scholia for this line for their respective manuscripts. Continued research into scholia that discuss word etymologies would be a fruitful first step as we investigate this issue further. If we can find similar patterns in the text of the scholia then we can begin to assemble a reasonable argument about the sources of the scholia.	
Another scholion that uses the first person is the most debatable case I found. It appears on lines 8.188-8.190, where Hector talks about how Andromache feeds his horses. The issue at stake is the appropriate order of the lines. The scholiast here argues for one order on the basis that wine must be mixed before it is consumed and therefore the poetry should talk about mixing first. The scholion reads:ὑμῖν παρ προτέροισιτὸ ἑξῆς τοῦτό ἐστιν "ἠ εμοὶ ὅς πέρ οἱ θαλερὸς πόσις εὔχομαι εἶναι" (190) "οἴνον τ' ἐγκεράσασα πιεῖν ὅτε" μοι "θυμὸς ἀνώγοι" (189) ἱστεον δὲ ὅτι προ τοῦ εὑρεθῆναι τὴν τῶν ποτηρίων χρῆσιν κέρασιν ἔπινον ⁑“Set before you:This is the appropriate line order in my opinion: "ἠ εμοὶ ὅς πέρ οἱ θαλερὸς πόσις εὔχομαι εἶναι" (190) then, "οἴνον τ' ἐγκεράσασα πιεῖν ὅτε θυμὸς ἀνώγοι" (189) and one must see that before being able to make use of the drinking cups they mix the drink.” This particular scholion poses a challenge because the use of the first person is subtle. It also debatable whether or not this is a genuine first person outside of a quote. We have what appears to be an out of place use of μοι, located in the middle of the second quoted line in the scholion. It is not unusual for a scholiast to interrupt a quote, but generally it is done with a verb like φημὶ. The Venetus A does not include the μοι in the main line of the poetry and its presence would render the line unmetrical, although still grammatically and logically correct. I would be less inclined to believe that this is a genuine first person if we did not have a similar usage in another scholion.	
An earlier scholion on line 8.150, similarly uses the personal pronoun to express a preference for a specific reading. In these lines, Diomedes discusses the shame he would feel at Hector deriding him for retreating, saying that he would rather be swallowed up by the earth than endure it. The scholion reads: ὥς πότ' ἀπειλήσειὅτι οὐκ εν τῷ καθόλου "εὑρεῖαν" λέγει, αλλ' εμοὶ "εὑρεῖα" ἡ γῆ γένοιτο ἀντι τοῦ "εὐρὺ χάσμα" ποιήσει ⁑“So that he may someday boast:The sign is there because in general he [the poet] does not say “εὑρεῖαν,” but in my opinion the earth would become “εὑρεῖα” instead of it making a “broad chasm.”” Here there is no question that the εμοὶ is genuinely a first person reference. There is no quote it could be a part of and it does not seem like a likely error. This scholion starts with the word ὅτι, which leads me to believe that it is quite possibly attributable to Aristarchus.  There is also a diple on the line, further reinforcing this hypothesis. It would be wonderful if we could reinforce this hypothesis with evidence from the Y.1.1. Unfortunately the Y.1.1 scholion not only has no citation of any particular source, but it also has slightly different content. It reads:τὸ "εὐρεῖα" ἀντὶ. τοῦ "εὐρέως" κρείσσων δέ φησι θάνατος ψόγου⁑It is “εὐρεῖα” instead of “εὐρέως,” and he says that death is better than disgrace. The two scholia agree on the same reading of the line, but offer different rejected alternatives. Occasionally we find that an Y.1.1 scholion will reinforce the theory that the ὅτι scholia of the Venetus A are attributable to Aristarchus but not so in this case. Here we find an instance of slightly differing traditions between the two manuscripts.Returning again to issues of first person singulars in the scholia, one of the few first persons I managed to find in the Y.1.1 appears in a scholion on line 8.70. Here, Zeus is seen weighing the fates of the Achaeans and the Trojans before battle. The scholion debates the logical issue of why there are two separate fates when there is only one outcome to the battle. I transcribed the scholion as follows:πῶς δύο κῆρας ἐντίθησιν ὁ Ζεὺς ὥσπερ ἀνὰ μίαν ἑκατέρου στρατοῦ. ἐν δὲ τοῖς ἑξῆς   πλείους αὐτὰς φησιν· "αἱ μὲν Ἀχαιῶν κῆρες" (Il. 8.73)· ὅτι αἱ δύο καὶ πολλαὶ ἂν εἶεν· λέγομεν γοῦν διττὰ πράγματα· πλειόνων δὲ ἔμφασιν διδόντος τοῦ ὀνόματος, εἰκότως ἐν τῇ μεταλήψει πλέονας εἶπεν· ἔστι δὲ τὸ σχῆμα. συνεκδοχικῶν σχημάτῶν ἕν· κὴρ δὲ εἶρηται παρὰ τὸ καίω· διὰ πυρὸς γὰρ ἔθαπτοντο· εἰ δὲ τὴν ψυχὴν δηλοῖ. παρὰ τὸν κηρόν· δίκην γὰρ αὐτοῦ τὰ μαθήματα ἐν ἑαυτῇ ἀπομάττεται⁑“How does Zeus set down two fates as there is one end for each army? In these matters they say that "πλειους" is a logical arrangement of words: "αἱ μὲν Ἀχαιῶν κῆρες" (“the fates of the Achaeans”) (Il. 8.73).  Because there may be "δυο" two or "πολλαι" many. Indeed I say that matters are twofold. But others it is "πλειονων" with the noun giving emphasis. Similarly in a change of case he [the poet] said "πλεονας." It is a figure of speech, one of the measuring out together figures of speech. Death is said to be like burning. Therefore one is put to rest through fire. If it releases the soul as if it were. For one customarily searches for knowledge in oneself.” One of the first things that struck me about this scholion is that is arranged much like one of Porphyry’s Homeric Questions. It presents a problem of logic and resolves it. In fact, there is a lengthy entry on the topic in Schrader’s edition of Porphyry’s Homeric Questions, Porphyrii quaestionum Homericarum ad Iliadem pertinentium reliquiae.  Some of the thoughts expressed in the Schrader edition appear similar. If anything, we may have a highly abbreviated, slightly adapted version of that text. It would be useful to further investigate this connection to the Homeric Questions and what that means for the mysterious first person present in this scholion.Speaking more generally about first person scholia, we can make a few more observations about the type of scholia that use the first person. When the first person scholiast uses the personal pronoun he is making judgements on the Iliadic text, be it understanding the logic behind the poetry or making decisions about what is genuine text of the Iliad. This practice is something that most of the scholia generally do but rarely with such a personal endorsement. It is possible, though not definitively proven, that we might be able to attribute some of this material to Aristarchus or perhaps another famous scholar. We cannot make too many assumptions about how interconnected these scholia were. They use different styles or combinations of styles. They comment on varying topics, and there are rarely parallels between the two manuscripts. Further research across a wider range of data and a refined automated search system are necessary to continue investigating these scholia and the patterns between them.
