There are many people without whom I would not have been able to accomplish as much as I have. Professors Mary Ebbott and Neel Smith first introduced me to the Homer Multitext project and taught me to read Byzantine Greek manuscripts as well as how to edit these texts into digital editions. Both professors worked endlessly with me on various aspects of this particular project. Professor Ebbott, as my direct advisor, put in incredible amounts of time with me reading scholia and everything I wrote. This thesis would not be half as eloquent without her committed efforts to making me explain myself properly. I would also like to thank my colleagues who devoted their free time to work on a project for which they were not receiving course credit. Brian Clark, Rebecca Musgrave, David Cieremans, and Patrick Rapuano all contributed to the editing of scholia and poetry of *Iliad* 8 in these two manuscripts. Brian and Rebecca were my co-editors for the scholia and I would not have an edition of the scholia in even one manuscript without their sacrifice of time and energy. These people went above and beyond and have my eternal gratitude for putting up with my perfectionism, panic, and late nights in a computer lab.
